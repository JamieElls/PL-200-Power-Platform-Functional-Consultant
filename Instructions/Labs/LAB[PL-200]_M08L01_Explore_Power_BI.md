### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon.
